# MSSLStyleGuide

Research projects at the cPASS Machine-Learning for Social Science Lab (MSSL) are complex in terms of authors, methods, and data. MSSL has adopted a project management system based on Github, RStudio, and Latex that is efficient, organized, transparent, and replicable. This Github repository titled MSSLStyleGuide documents this system as it develops and guides new users in setting up a work station, joining a project, and developing and documenting content. 

## Setup

### Work Station Setup

To collaborate on a MSSL project you need the following:

#### Dropbox

MSSL has a Dropbox business account named "rex". If you have not yet been invited, create a [MSSLStyleGuide issue](https://github.com/rexdouglass/MSSLStyleGuide/issues) with the label "MSSL". If you already have a personal Dropbox account, you can connect it to "rex"; the two accounts will remain seperate but you will be able to access both of them on all your devices.

In the Dropbox folder, create a folder titled github_private. This folder is where you will keep projects to make edits and then push to the cloud. 

You will also be given access to a shared folder called "MSSL". This folder is mainly for data files that are proprietary or too big for github. 

Your Dropbox should ultimately look like this, along with your personal folders. Your github_private will initially be empty until you join specific projects.

#### R and RStudio

#### Github

#### Latex



### Project Setup

## Datawork

### General Coding

Underscores "_" not periods "."

### Data Storage

### Functions in R

#### Writing Functions

- R functions go in their own individual .r file.
- The name of the file should be the same as the name of the function
- [Functions should have documentation using roxygen headers](https://rexdouglass.github.io/MSSLStyleGuide/Function_Documentation.nb.html)

#### Calling Functions

- [Calling functions from other packages](http://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/pages/depends.html)
- As a lab, we'll be using the :: operator every single time we call a function from an external package, e.g. glue::glue, plyr::dplyr

### Packages

- All calls to external packages should made on the Imports and Suggests lines in the DESCRIPTION file. Any calls to library() in the analysis should be commented out.
- [Packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/)

### Analysis in R-Notebook

All analysis should be in an R-Notebook.

select File -> New File -> R Notebook

### R-Markdown

Each R-Markdown should be self-contained with unique outputs
