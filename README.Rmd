# MSSLStyleGuide

Research projects at the cPASS Machine-Learning for Social Science Lab (MSSL) are complex in terms of authors, methods, and data. To efficiently and transparently manage these projects, MSSL has established a project system based on Github, RStudio, and Latex. This Github repository titled MSSLStyleGuide documents this system as it develops and guides new users in setting up a work station, joining a project, and developing and documenting content. 

## R Projects

### General

Underscores "_" not periods "."

### Packages

- All calls to external packages should made on the Imports and Suggests lines in the DESCRIPTION file. Any calls to library() in the analysis should be commented out.
- [Packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/)

### Functions

#### Writing Functions

- R functions go in their own individual .r file.
- The name of the file should be the same as the name of the function
- [Functions should have documentation using roxygen headers](https://rexdouglass.github.io/MSSLStyleGuide/Function_Documentation.nb.html)

#### Calling Functions

- [Calling functions from other packages](http://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/pages/depends.html)
- As a lab, we'll be using the :: operator every single time we call a function from an external package, e.g. glue::glue, plyr::dplyr

### R-Notebooks

All analysis should be in an R-Notebook.

select File -> New File -> R Notebook


### R-Markdown

Each R-Markdown should be self-contained with unique outputs
