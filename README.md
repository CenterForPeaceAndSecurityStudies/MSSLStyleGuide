MSSLStyleGuide
==============

Research projects at the cPASS Machine-Learning for Social Science Lab (MSSL) are complex in terms of authors, methods, and data. MSSL has adopted a project management system based on Github, RStudio, and Latex that is:

-   efficient - everyone has access to every part of the project
-   organized - establishes a central repository for data, analysis, issues, and tasks
-   transparent - changes are tracked and previous iterations can be instantly recalled
-   replicable - when ready the repository can be made public and serve as the replication package

This Github repository titled MSSLStyleGuide documents this system as it develops and guides new users in setting up a work station, joining a project, and developing and documenting content.

To simplify editing, style guide has been moved to the [MSSLStyleGuide wiki](https://github.com/CenterForPeaceAndSecurityStudies/MSSLStyleGuide/wiki).
