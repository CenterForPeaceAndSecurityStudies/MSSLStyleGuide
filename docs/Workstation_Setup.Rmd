To collaborate on a MSSL project you need to set-up Github, Dropbox, R (and RStudio), and Latex.

# Github

[Github](https://github.com/) is a development platform for managing coding projects. If you do not already have a github profile, [sign up for a free account](https://github.com/). When you are logged in, go to [Rex Douglass's account](https://github.com/rexdouglass) and select "Follow" under profile picture. Rex will add you to the repository for a project; you can remind him to by selecting the appropriate repository, selecting the "Issues" tab (between "Code" and "Pull requests") and creating a "New Issue".

# Dropbox

MSSL has a [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) business account named "rex". If you have not yet been invited, create a [MSSLStyleGuide issue](https://github.com/rexdouglass/MSSLStyleGuide/issues) with the label "MSSL". If you already have a personal Dropbox account, you can connect it to "rex"; the two accounts will remain seperate but you will be able to access both of them on all your devices.

In the Dropbox folder, create a folder titled "github_private". This folder is where you will keep projects to make edits and then push to the cloud. 

You will also be given access to a shared folder called "MSSL". This folder is mainly for data files that are proprietary or too big for github. 

When ready Dropbox should look like below with "github_private" and "MSSL" located in "Dropbox (rex)".

Note that "github_private"" will initially be empty until you join specific projects.

# R and RStudio

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphcis. It is freely available, very flexible, and make pretty plots. [Download R from the UCLA mirror](http://cran.stat.ucla.edu/) for your operating system and install it.

[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is a workspace that sits on top of R and makes it easier to edit code, plot data, and share your work. When working in R you will actually open RStudio application instead of the R application. [Download the installer of the free open source version](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) for your operating system and install it. 

# Latex

To be added.
