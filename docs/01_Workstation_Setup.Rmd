To collaborate on a MSSL project you need to set-up Github, Dropbox, R (and RStudio), and Latex.

# Git and Github

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a version control system for managing projects and [Github](https://github.com/) is an online hosting service for Git repositories. 

If you do not already have a github profile, [sign up for a free account](https://github.com/). When you are logged in, go to [Rex Douglass's account](https://github.com/rexdouglass) and select "Follow" under profile picture. Rex will add you to the repository for a project; you can remind him to by selecting the appropriate repository, selecting the "Issues" tab (between "Code" and "Pull requests") and creating a "New Issue".

You also have to [download and install the git software](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Once you have R and RStudio installed, there are additional steps below to enable Git within RStudio.

# Dropbox

MSSL uses [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) to share large and proprietary datasets; dropbox also helps users move between different workstations and keep them synced. 

In the Dropbox folder, create a folder titled "github_private". This folder is where you will keep projects to make edits and then push to the cloud. 

MSSL has a shared dropbox folder called "MSSL". This folder is mainly for data files that are proprietary or too big for github. Since this can get big, MSSL has business account named "rex". You can connect your personal dropbox account to "rex"; the two accounts will remain seperate but you will be able to access both of them on all your devices.

For undergrads, MSSL will create a project specific folder in the team folder ("MSSL_team") and only share that. 

If you need access to "rex" and "MSSL" and haven't been invited yet, create a [MSSLStyleGuide issue](https://github.com/rexdouglass/MSSLStyleGuide/issues) with the label "MSSL". 

When ready Dropbox should look like below with "github_private" and (probably) "MSSL" located in "Dropbox (rex)".

Note that "github_private"" will initially be empty until you join specific projects.

# R and RStudio

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphcis. It is freely available, very flexible, and make pretty plots. [Download R from the UCLA mirror](http://cran.stat.ucla.edu/) for your operating system and install it.

[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is a workspace that sits on top of R and makes it easier to edit code, plot data, and share your work. When working in R you will actually open RStudio application instead of the R application. [Download the installer of the free open source version](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) for your operating system and install it. 

To set up Git with RStudio:
1. Open RStudio
2. Go to Global Options (from the Tools menu)
3. Click Git/SVN
4. Click Enable version control interface for RStudio projects

# Latex

To be added.

# Joining a project

Now that your workstation is ready, you can move on to [project setup](https://rexdouglass.github.io/MSSLStyleGuide/Project_Setup.nb.html).
