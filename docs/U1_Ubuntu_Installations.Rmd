# Setup Ubuntu 

## R and Rstudio

https://www.r-project.org/

https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

The blog post https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-install-r-ubuntu-16-04-xenial/ walks you through installing through terminal. It's great, but check the R and Rstudio websites to get the most recent version numbers.

```{terminal}
sudo apt-get install gdebi-core
wget https://download1.rstudio.org/rstudio-1.1.383-amd64.deb
sudo gdebi -n rstudio-1.1.383-amd64.deb
rm rstudio-1.1.383-amd64.deb
```

Additional components that might be needed for building with R with you get an error saying they are missing:

```{terminal}
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install libssl-dev

sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev

```



These are definitely needed for the "sf" package, which is used in NamedEntities

```{terminal}
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install libgeos-dev

sudo apt-get install libudunits2-dev

sudo apt-get install libgdal1-dev # this might install gdal 1, which gets upgraded below

sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable
sudo apt update 
sudo apt upgrade # if you already have gdal 1.11 installed 
sudo apt install gdal-bin python-gdal python3-gdal # if you don't have gdal 1.11 already installed 
```




## GIT

Run the following from terminal with your own git email and username

```{terminal}
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git-core
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

```
